		<h2>Known limitations</h2>
	
			<subsection name="Testing with Eclipse">

				Building the aspects with Eclipse may show unit test failures. This depends on 
				how the Eclipse projects was created. In order for the Aspects to work they must
				be compiled in by the Maven AspectJ plugin. If you wish to test the actual aspects
				in Eclipse then I'd recommend the AJDT plugin. You may also need to build with maven
				then run the tests in Eclipse. 
				
				The issue is that a normal Eclipse build does not apply aspects.
